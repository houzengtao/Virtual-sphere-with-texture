3D motion virtual reproduction
Using NDI's optical capture device and VC++6.0, we developed an artificial joint performance evaluation system. 
The visual optical capture module is produced by NDI, a U.S.-based company. 
The binocular system can determine spatial coordinates, and the reflective small spheres reflect infrared light of a specific wavelength band. 
The measurement accuracy can reach 0.3mm, with a frame rate of 60 frames per second.
